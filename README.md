# Translators
Translators may edit their language's file. If your language's file does not exist, you may create one with the name "lang-en.lua", where en is replaced with your language's two character ISO 639-1 code. You can view unfinished translations in the "lang-en.lua" file, but please do not copy the "LANG" translations, as they are supposed to stay in their native languages.
